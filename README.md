# Crescendo-Music-Education-v2
A relaunch of the CME website using Django & Nginx hosted on Digitalocean cloud service
### If you want to develop on the front-end:
Make sure to edit the index_dev.html file when testing on a local machine, in the pages/templates folder
because that's the file that isn't linked by Django static files.
Then, update the index.html file as well so that the changes can be applied to the live site.

### Notes:
* Changes will not be actually applied until it's manually pushed onto the server.
## TODO:
1. Upload static HTML home page to server using Django flatpages
2. Create various other static pages.
3. Create signup page.
4. Create tutors page
